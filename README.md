# RIThM
Redundancy via Information-Theoretic Measures

This is a C++ library for computing mean subsystem entropy, redundancy, and degeneracy (functional redundancy) from multivariate time series data. Include `RIThM.h` in code to use functions. The other library `itertools.h` is currently a fork of a project by Howard Hinnant (https://github.com/HowardHinnant) for sampling combinations. I intended to make some changes in my fork, but so far I haven't.

Other dependencies:
Eigen (including unsupported functions in Eigen)

For overview of functions, see `refman.pdf`.
